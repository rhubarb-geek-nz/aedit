<P>Back in the day, aedit was an ISIS-II 8080 port of the 8086 alter text editor, that in turn ran on the Intellec MDS 8086 co-processor.</P>
<P>PC-DOS 1.1 only came with edlin. I wrote an 8086 assembler version of aedit for PC-DOS, it was written using edlin and masm.</P>
<P>I later wrote a CP/M version, in Z80 assembler to run on a 380Z.</P>
<P>This version here is a very portable C implementation, originally written on QNX running on an 8088.</P>
